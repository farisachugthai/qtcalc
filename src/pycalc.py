Notes on QWidget and parent-child relationships
-----------------------------------------------

In PyQt5, you can use any widget (a subclass of QWidget) as a top-level
window, or even a button or a label. The only condition is that you pass no
parent to it. When you use a widget like this, PyQt5 automatically gives it a
title bar and turns it into a normal window.

The parent-child relationship is used for two complementary purposes:

A widget that doesnâ€™t have a parent is a main window or a top-level window. A
widget that has a parent (which is always another widget) is contained (or
shown) within its parent. This relationship also defines ownership, with
parents owning their children. The PyQt5 ownership model ensures that if you
delete a parent (for example, a top-level window), then all of its children
(widgets) are automatically deleted as well.

To avoid memory leaks, you should always make sure that any QWidget object
has a parent, with the sole exception of top-level windows
